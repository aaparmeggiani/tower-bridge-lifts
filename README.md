# Tower Bridge / lifts

![Update lifts.json](https://github.com/aaparmeggiani/towerbridge/workflows/Update%20lifts.json/badge.svg)

This repo parses data from the official Tower Bridge page &mdash; https://www.towerbridge.org.uk/lift-times &mdash; and makes it available in JSON format at: 

https://aaparmeggiani.github.io/towerbridge/lifts.json 

## Notes
- Updated hourly, with a small delay between schedule/execution by [github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions).
- Results mirror the official source. As past lifts are not deleted necessarily straight after they happen, the top of the list might not correspond to the next lift.
